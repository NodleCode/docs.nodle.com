# Nodle Token Economic Concepts

## Max Supply

The maximum supply of the NODL token is 21 billion, no additional tokens can be minted once the protocol reaches this number. Nodle was originally built on another chain in 2018[^1], where approximately 8.4 billion tokens were minted, it was then migrated to a native Nodle Chain in 2020. The rest of the tokens constituting the max supply will be minted according to the predictable mechanisms described in section “token issuance”.

## Token Allocation

In the early stages of the Nodle Chain, approximately 8 billion Nodle cash was minted and attributed to reward, incentivize the team and early investors; as well as to create a treasury aimed at financing and driving the growth of the network and its ecosystem. The first participants received tokens as part of the network rewards incentives.The rest of un-mined tokens will be minted through the issuance mechanism described in the dedicated section. 
The following is a snapshot of the Token Allocation upon migration of Nodle Cash to its Native blockchain in 2020. 

The treasury will serve a number of objectives:
- Incentivize third party developers through grants to accelerate and drive the development of the network. Such grants will be allocated for building services on top of the network (such as asset tracking services, digital witnessing, geo-localized NFTs…), building infrastructure for the token ecosystem (gateways, interactions with smart missions, explorers, statistics, hardware wallets, corporate wallets, governance dashboards, security modules…), or to subsidize early usage of the network (in hackathons, or for subsidizing IoT startups to utilize the Nodle network, or to subsidize the use of  B2C apps using the network such as the Nodle cash app.
- Create awareness around Nodle and its ecosystem in order to stimulate usage, sustain value of the coin, and to educate users, developers and businesses
- Secure a reserve for the DAO: more about that below.

At first, the Nodle team controlled this treasury. It is now controlled through the Nodle governance council of token holders. In the future, it will be transitioned under the control of a Nodle DAO responsible for driving future evolutions of the network.

## Market capitalization and token supply

The market capitalization or “market cap” of a crypto network is computed by multiplying the “token supply” and the “token market price”. As the token is not yet listed, and does not have a market price, there is no single market cap, fixed by an open market on an open exchange. Although market capitalization is thus not relevant at this stage, it is important to highlight the token supply and its dynamics in coming months and coming years.

Different projects and communities may take unique approaches to evaluate the token supply of a crypto network. In the case of Nodle, the consensus is to use the circulating supply. Circulating supply represents tokens that are free to be traded, exchanged or used on the network. Non-circulating supply includes:

- Unmined tokens:tokens yet to be issued by the chain
- Locked funds: tokens purchased by investors under a contract locking the tokens for an agreed period of time and tokens that have been allocated by the Nodle company to key people, but are kept in escrow until they execute the vesting period contracted. While they are not circulating, the tokens cannot be used to participate in the Nodle economy, which means they don’t provide utility to the network. A utility token represents units of value being exchanged on the marketplace. Market capitalization should thus take circulating supply into consideration.
