# The NODL Token
The token of the Nodle Chain is Nodle Cash, and its symbol is NODL. The Nodle Chain is a Polkadot parachain. In this document we go through the economics of the NODL token, its function in the Nodle Network and the supply and demand dynamics.



## The Vision

The Nodle network aims to achieve two goals:
- **To create an economic and technical layer that enables smartphones to be rewarded for performing work**. This means leveraging the existing infrastructure of smartphones to execute applications, such as a decentralized edge computing platform, a crowdsourced sensing network, or rewarding users to perform tasks without a middle man.
- **To become a force of democratization for the crypto space**, i.e. distributing a crypto token to a large number of participants.

### A Swarm Network of Smartphones
Edge Nodes provide connectivity in the physical world and processing related to this connectivity. A smartphone is "in the world." Unlike a computer in a data center, a smartphone can be anywhere - in the countryside or the middle of a city.

**The Nodle network takes advantage of four things:**
- **A smartphone is a computing machine**: it is, in many cases, as powerful as a laptop computer. It can run processes at the "edge." In many parts of the world, the smartphone is the most powerful computing machine a person owns.
- **A smartphone is connected and can access many different networks**: Wi-Fi, LTE, Bluetooth, and NFC.
- **A smartphone has many sensors**: camera, microphone, accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS, with new sensors regularly being added.
- **There is typically a one-to-one relationship with its owner**, that is a smartphone belongs to a single person.

### A Force for Democratization
**The smartphone is the most commonly distributed technology ever invented**. As of 2021, the number of smartphone users was 6.378 billion, according to Statista. This translates to about 80% of the world's population. There are few things in computing as simple as downloading an app and running it - itâ€™s what smartphones are built to do.

On the Nodle network, participants are not given "free share" - rather they are rewarded for a service they provide, or more precisely, for a service their smartphone offers.
You can compare it to cloud platforms: cloud providers create an infrastructure that can be "rented" by developers. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are getting paid by developers for the cloud platform service they provide. In the Nodle network, the participants, i.e., the Nodes running the piece of code inside the Nodle SDK, get rewarded in Nodle Cash (NODL) for their service. So, in this case, the infrastructure is the swarm of smartphones.

The NODL token solves the cold start problem. In the regular economy, venture capital, investment banking, and sometimes subsidies from the State come together to finance technological projects until they can reach economic sustainability. In the case of cloud platforms or telecommunication networks, the provider has to make the initial investments. 
In crypto-economies, the token plays that role. The Bitcoin network incentivizes miners to deploy a decentralized mining infrastructure offering a service: securing a monetary network. The Nodle network incentivizes smartphone owners to run a connectivity infrastructure.
