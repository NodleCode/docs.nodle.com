# The Nodle Parachain
The Nodle Chain is [Polkadot's 11th Parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains) powering the Nodle Network. It is used to settle network incentives and contracts in the form of [Nodle Cash ($NODL)](nodl), as well as run some upcoming decentralized applications building atop the Network. It is built with the [Parity Substrate](https://substrate.io/) framework is available under an [open source license](https://github.com/NodleCode/chain).

Due to its permissionless nature, anybody can [run a Nodle Chain full-node](run-a-node) in order to help make it available and distribute its state. In order to further increase its decentralization and security, it will soon be possible to [run a collator node](become-a-collator) or [help choose collators](stake-your-nodle-cash), in exchange of a share of the Nodle Chain's revenues. Token holders of Nodle Cash will also be able to use their holdings in order to participate in the governance of the Nodle Chain, and thus assume its decentralized ownership.
