# The Nodle Chain
The Nodle Chain is [Polkadot's 11th Parachain](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains) powering the Nodle Network. It is used to settle network incentives and contracts in the form of [Nodle Cash ($NODL)](nodl), as well as run some upcoming decentralized applications building atop the Network. It is built with the [Parity Substrate](https://substrate.io/) framework is available under an [open source license](https://github.com/NodleCode/chain).

Due to its permissionless nature, anybody can [run a Nodle Chain full-node](run-a-node) in order to help make it available and distribute its state. In order to further increase its decentralization and security, it will soon be possible to [run a collator node](become-a-collator) or [help choose collators](stake-your-nodle-cash), in exchange of a share of the Nodle Chain's revenues.
