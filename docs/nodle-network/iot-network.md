# Using the Nodle network for IoT

The Nodle network harnesses the power of smartphones to securely and privately interact with their smart devices, without relying on a dedicated telecom infrastructure such as 5G or LPWAN networks from telecom operators. The cryptocurrency NODL creates the economic incentive for smartphones to participate in the network, thus leveraging an existing infrastructure (smartphones with BLE activated and their internet connectivity) to deploy a unique IoT network, instead of deploying new antennas.

## Infrastructure free, high precision, and programmable

Compared to 5G networks or dedicated Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) provided by telecom operators (which includes technologies such as LoRaWAN, NB-IoT or Sigfox), the Nodle network generates no cost of deploying new hardware infrastructure, thus creating economically viable long term opportunities. This network has worldwide coverage, and high precision from the geolocation of the smartphone, alogn with the potential of the Nodle virtual machine able to execute code at each node to interact with your devices.

## Connecting the next billion things

The low cost of manufacturing and deploying a smart device with a BLE chip enables a whole new range of use cases, particularly in urban areas where the network of smartphone has more density. Until now, connecting objects with low value was too expensive. With the Nodle network, any pallets, vehicles, packages, meters, containers, actuators, cameras or sensors can be connected. For companies with strong logistics challenge (transportation, delivery, distribution, urban services such as waste management, water or energy supply, traffic monitoring, stock optimizationâ€¦), the Nodle network can unlock new opportunities.

## Asset tracking: a managed service demonstrating the first DApp on the Nodle network
The first dApp to run on top of the Nodle network is an asset tracking service provided by the Nodle team, currently in closed beta. Partners of Nodle provision a fleet of smart devices they own, communicating through Bluetooth Low Energy. Each node running the SDK at the edge can access the list of target nodes and scan in the open to find the nodes. Once located, the data is sent back to the owner of the device through an API.

## The future: a decentralized swarm computing network
Beyond asset tracking, the Nodle network will become an open ecosystem for innovation at the edge. Any IoT developer will have the tools to write smart missions on the chain, that will then be executed at the edge by the nodes of the network, enabling complex interactions between smart devices and the nodes through the Nodle Virtual Machine.
