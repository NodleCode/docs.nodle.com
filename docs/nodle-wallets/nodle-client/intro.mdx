# Introduction

The Nodle Client is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for managing your NODL assets. It provides a native UI that improves the experience when connecting your account with different providers, such as PolkadotJS, Talisman, and Ledger (though Ledger support is still under development and is not fully recommended for use). See more here.

Also support:

- Spanish language
- Testnet and Mainnent support
- Dark/Light theme

### Connection

The very first page you will see is the connection modal, which guides you through the process of connecting your wallet.
The connection modal is a simple and wizard-like process that makes it easy to connect your wallet to the Nodle Client.
Once you have connected your wallet, you will be able to access all of your NODL assets and manage them using the Nodle Client.

### Account Page

The Account Overview page provides you with a summary of your account information, including your balance, account address, and transaction history.

### NFT Page

The NFT Overview page lists all of the NFTs that you own. Each NFT has a name, description and cover. You can click on an NFT to view more information about it.
