# Bulk Minter

The Bulk Minter is the easiest way to create a collection of NFTs with multiple items. This can be useful for a variety of use cases, such as:

- Minting collections for events
- Promotions
- Controlled airdrops
And more.

Each item in the collection is sent to a claimable account, which can also hold NODL tokens. The start page has two options: Mint NFT and Distribute NFT.

### Mint NFT

This guide will walk you through the process of minting a collection with multiple NFTs (items).

**Step 1**: Mint NFTs

In this step, you will specify the number of NFTs you want to mint and the amount of NODL tokens you want to send to each NFT holder. You can also specify a campaign name, which will be used by Nodle to track the analytics and improve the user experience.

**Step 2**: Collection

In this step, you will create a collection for your NFTs. You will need to specify a name and description for the collection. You can also upload a cover image for the collection.

**Step 3**: Item

In this step, you will create an item for your NFT collection. You will need to specify a name and description for the item. You can also upload an image for the item.

**Step 4**: Resume

This step will show you a summary of the fees and payment information for your minting process. The fees include the minting fee, the claiming fee, and the distributed NODL. The total to pay is the sum of these fees.

**Step 5**: Payment

In this step, you will need to provide a Wallet JSON file and its password. You can get a Wallet JSON file from your wallet provider. This is required to bypass the signature while the process is creating as many transactions as items you need, making the process more faster.

**Step 6**: Minting started

Once you click the "Start Minting" button, the minting process will start. It is important to keep the tab or window open until the minting process is complete.

**Step 7**: Minting successful

Once the minting process is complete, you will see a message that says "Minting successful". You can then download the result of the process, which is a JSON file containing all the accounts generated to hold 1 item and if so NODL tokens.

### Distribute NFTs

This section allows you to display the payloads contained in the result of the Minting NFTs process. This will list all the accounts showing the QR codes and claim URLs.

There is only one step: Upload JSON. Selecting a valid JSON file will redirect you to the Claimable list. Each item in the list is clickable and will give you more details, including the QR code and URL section required to claim it.

The items that have already been claimed will be marked as such.
