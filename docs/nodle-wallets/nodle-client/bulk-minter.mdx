# NFT minting tool

The NFT minting tool allows NODL token holders to easily generate multiple NFTs and distribute them to others.

Unlike the standard Nodle app that is focused on personal use, this tool is specifically designed for NFT creators to distribute their works to a wider audience. To mint NFTs for personal collection, users should continue to use the Nodle app.

The tool significantly simplifies and accelerates the process of generating and distributing multiple NFTs. Once NFTs are minted, creators simply need to share a link or a QR code with the intended recipient. The recipient can then utilize the provided link or QR code to claim their NFT.

The NFT minting tool unveils a wealth of new use cases for the Nodle network and chain, flawlessly integrating web3 into the tangible world. For example:
- minting commemorative NFTs for distribution on events
- minting NFTs to boost participation in loyalty programs by distributing them to participants
- minting NFTs for concents to distribute them as a gift
- and much more.

### Accessing the NFT minting tool

Access the NFT minting tool through the Nodle Client. Open the Nodle Client and navigate to the menu located in the top right corner and select "Mint and distribute NFTs." Please note, that you donâ€™t have to log in to the Nodle Client to access the minting tool.

The initial page of the tool presents a choice between two options: Mint NFTs and Distribute NFTs. Kindly pick the appropriate option based on your intended action.

### Mint NFTs

This guide will walk you through the process of minting a collection of multiple NFTs for distribution.

#### Step 1: Mint NFTs

At this step, you'll define the quantity of NFTs you intend to create, along with the quantity of NODL tokens designated for each NFT recipient. Additionally, there's an option to name your campaign, which Nodle will utilize for analytics monitoring and enhancing user interaction.

#### Step 4: Summary

#### Step 5: Payment

At this step, you will need to upload the wallet JSON file and enter your Polkadot password. Your JSON file can be downloaded from the Polkadot.JS Chrome extension. Open the extension, select the three dots adjacent to the account, and click the "Export Account" button.
    
If you have never used Polkadot.JS, install it to your Chrome browser, click the plus button, and select "Import account from pre-existing seed." Enter your 12-word recovery phrase (accessible in the Nodle app) and select "Nodle Parachain" as the Network. Input the account name and password. Subsequently, you will be able to export your JSON file.

#### Step 6: Minting started

Once you click the "Start Minting" button, the minting process will start. It is important to keep the tab or window open until the minting process is complete.


#### Step 7: Minting successful

Once the minting process is completed, you will see a message that says "Minting successful". You can then download the result of the process, which is a JSON file containing temporary wallets and claiming links.

### Distribute NFTs

NFT distribution can be accomplished through the minting tool or by automating the process using a script to parse the JSON file.

To use the minting tool for distribution, please adhere to the following steps:

1. Open the minting tool via the Nodle Client by navigating to the menu in the top right corner and selecting "Mint and distribute NFTs."
2. Click on "Distribute NFTs" to begin.
3. Upload the JSON file, that you downloaded at the end of the minting flow.
4. Once the file has been processed, a complete collection of NFTs will be displayed. Click on an NFT to view its QR code and show it to the recipient, or copy the claiming link and send it to the recipient.

The file can also be uploaded from a mobile browser, making it possible to conveniently share NFTs directly from a mobile device.
