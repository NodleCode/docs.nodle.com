# View your account on Subscan

1. Go to [Subscan](https://nodle.subscan.io/).
   
   Here is what the interface should look like:

   ![Subscan Main Page](/img/docs/subscan-main.png)

2. Grab the address you want to review and insert it in the upper bar:

   ![Subscan Search](/img/docs/subscan-search.png)

   Notice that each address will have two or more different identifications, starting with `4` or with `5` (and sometimes with `1`). they all point to the same wallet!
3. Click on “Search” or press "Enter"
4. A new page will open up with the details of that wallet:

   ![Subscan Wallet View](/img/docs/subscan-wallet.png)

   This token holder, for example, has 20K NODL unlocked “Transferable”, and has not done any transfer (at least after the parachain migration). They do not have locked tokens.
