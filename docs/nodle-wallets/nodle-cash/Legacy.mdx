# Wallet management

### Backup Wallet

The most important thing to do with your Nodle app is to back up your 12 words. Your 12 words are used to generate your private key and act as a password to access your account.
On your Nodle app, go to `Settings > Wallet Settings > Recovery phrase`.

### How can I import my wallet from the Nodle app to the web?

Detailed instructions on [how to import your account from the app to the web](./reimport-your-account).


### How can I use my wallet with other apps?

We suggest using an application called [Talisman](../talisman/introduction) to handle your wallet on your computer. 
But don't worry if you're using other apps like Polkadot JS, SubWallet, or Nova. They should work just fine as long 
as you're using a newer version of the Nodle wallet.


### What is a public key and where can I find mine?

Think of your public key as your mailing address in the world of Nodle Cash, similar to how your email address is used to receive emails. 
You can freely share your public key with others. They'll use it to send you Nodle Cash, just like someone would use your email address to send you a message. 
Wondering where to find your public key? It's easy! Simply open your Nodle Cash app, and tap the "Receive" button found under your account balance. 


### What does 'legacy Nodle wallet' mean?

The Nodle app offers two types of wallet systems: legacy and non-legacy. 
Think of a 'legacy' wallet as an older version, which may be more complicated to move or "import" to other wallets that support NODL tokens. 
In some cases, it might not even be compatible with these other wallets. 
However, it's still a functioning wallet, and you can use it as you always have.

If you're new to the Nodle network, you're likely using a non-legacy wallet, which is simpler to use with other wallets. 
To check your wallet type, go to the screen with your public key (your 'wallet address') by tapping the "Receive" button in the app. 
If the app indicates you're using a legacy wallet, it might be a good idea to switch to a new one for easier use. 
If it doesn't say anything, rest assured you're using a non-legacy wallet.


### How can I switch to a new wallet from a legacy one?

The app can automatically upgrade your wallet during the wallet import if you have 0 balance.
In this case, you will get a new public key, which you need to share with your peers to receive transfers. Your 
12-word recovery phrase will not change, so you don't need to back up your wallet again. Your rewards and transfer
history will start from scratch.

Otherwise, it would be best to switch to a new wallet manually. It means that you need to create a new wallet and transfer
all your tokens there.
Here is what you need to do:
1. Make sure your current wallet is backed up! If not, backup your current wallet by going to Settings > Wallet Settings >
Recovery phrase
2. Disconnect your current wallet by going to Settings > Wallet settings > Disconnect wallet
3. Create a new wallet as you did it before
4. Backup the new wallet
5. Check your new wallet public key by clicking the "Receive" button and save it
6. Switch to your current wallet by disconnecting the new one and importing the current using a 12-word recovery phrase
7. Transfer your balance to the new wallet using your new public key by clicking the "Send" button
8. Switch back to your new wallet again
9. You are done! Continue enjoying the Nodle app!

### What if I received a transfer to a legacy wallet after being upgraded?

No worries, your tokens are not lost! You can [re-import your legacy wallet as an account to nodleprotocol.io](./reimport-your-account) and 
transfer your tokens to your new wallet. For the import, you should use your current 12-word recovery phrase, but select 
"Edwards" in the Advanced creation options selector.

### What is a private key? Where can I find my private key?

A private key is like a password — a string of letters and numbers — that allows you to access and manage your crypto 
funds. It is used to sign every transaction you make on the blockchain. A human-readable form of your wallet's private 
key is a recovery phrase (or "seed phrase", "mnemonics"). The recovery phrase is composed of 12 secret words. You can 
find your recovery phrase in the Nodle app by going to Settings > Wallet settings > Recovery phrase. It is very important 
to write down those words on paper and keep them somewhere safe and secure as it is the only way to access your tokens.

### How can I move my wallet to another device?

To move your account to another device, firstly, you need to backup your wallet on your current device.
You can do it in the Nodle app by going to Settings > Wallet Settings > Recovery phrase. As a result,
you will get your secret phrase consisting of 12 words that you will use to import your wallet to another device.

Once you back up your wallet, install the app on another device and use your 12-word phrase to import your wallet
to another device.

### How can I transfer my tokens to another Nodle wallet?

You can transfer your tokens to another Nodle wallet in the Nodle app. You need to know a public key of the
recipient’s wallet to do this. Once you have it, click on the “Send” button on the wallet tab and follow the instructions.
Please note that you will be charged a transaction fee for every transaction by the Polkadot blockchain. The fee amount
is calculated right before you confirm the transfer, and you can check it in the app. Once you confirm the transaction,
you will see it in the list of “Transfers” below your balance.

### How can I recover my wallet if I lose my recovery phrase?

Your account can be recovered only with your recovery phrase. Your recovery phrase is not available to anybody except you. So,
unfortunately, it is not possible to recover your account if you lose your recovery phrase.

### Is it possible to run the app on multiple devices with the same wallet?

We recommend you to create a separate account for each of your devices as it will be easier to track your rewards. We
also recommend using those devices in different locations to create a wider coverage and get higher rewards.
