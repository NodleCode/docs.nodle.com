# Create an Account on Web Browser

:::important
Please note that in-browser account creation and storage is NOT secure, and it is done at your own risk. 
If you’re looking for safer and longer term wallets, then we recommend creating your accounts on browser extensions such as [https://docs.nodle.com/docs/nodle-wallets/polkadot-js/how-to-create-a-nodle-cash-wallet](Polkadot JS), [https://docs.nodle.com/docs/nodle-wallets/polkadot-js/ledger](Ledger), [https://docs.nodle.com/docs/nodle-wallets/talisman/import-legacy-mobile](Talisman) or on the [https://docs.nodle.com/docs/nodle-wallets/nodle-cash/reimport-your-account](Nodle App).

To create an account on the web browser, follow these steps. 

## Step 1: Go to [https://nodleprotocol.io/#/accounts](https://nodleprotocol.io/#/accounts), select Nodle Mainnet.

## Step 6: Add a new account by clicking on the + button. A pop-window appears.

## Step 7: The system displays a mnemonic seed, by default, as shown in the figure here. If required, you can also store the seeds in the “raw” format by selecting the Raw seed option from the Mnemonic drop-down menu.

## Step 8: Save the seed by storing it safely and confirm the same by selecting the check box at the bottom.

## Step 9: To select more advanced features, click the Advanced creation options. 
Note: Select this option only if you need to use alternative cryptographic curves for managing your wallet keys.  For example, if you are importing your old Nodle App wallet, then you may need to use crypto keys.  

## Step 10: When done, click Next. 

## Step 11:Now, give your account a unique name.
 
## Step 12: Enter a strong password. You must use a lengthy and randomly generated password. Use a password generator or manager to generate a password. Manual entry of passwords do not work.

## Step 14: Save your changes and ensure you store this information in a secure location. On clicking Save, a copy of your mnemonic seed is downloaded to your system automatically.
