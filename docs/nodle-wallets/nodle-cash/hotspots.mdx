## Nodle Hotspots

### Do I need the main Nodle app to use the Hotspot app?

Yes, the Hotspot app relies on the main Nodle app, which should be installed on your primary phone. Here's why: your primary device holds something called a "private key" for your Hotspot, which is like a password that gives it the right to collect your Hotspot earnings.

The Hotspot app, on the other hand, doesn't have this private key. It only has a "public key," which is a sort of identity marker but doesn't give it the power to transfer your earnings. This means you can't collect your earnings through the Hotspot app aloneâ€”you'll need the main Nodle app for that.

In the future, we might introduce a feature in the Hotspot app called a "Machine mode," which might have its own private key, but this is yet to be decided.

### Will I earn more with the Hotspot app?

The Nodle Network rewards nodes for their availability and their geospatial coverage. It means that:

- You will earn more if you create stable and reliable Nodle Network coverage in your location, which can be reached by
 placing several phones in the same location
- You will earn more if you create wider Nodle Network coverage meaning you place several phones in different locations
 far away from each other
- You will earn more if the app is available 24/7 with a stable internet connection and Bluetooth switched on

All of that can be reached in the Nodle Hotspot app:

- You can keep up to 4 phones in the same location to create stable and reliable Nodle Network coverage in one place 
and get higher rewards.
- You can safely place the Hotspot device far away from you and from your other devices to create wider Nodle Network 
coverage. Nobody will be able to steal your NODL tokens as they can only be collected from the main Nodle app.
- The Hotspot app is aimed to be used on devices that are plugged in and online 24/7, it is likely that the availability 
will be greater than on the main phone.

All mentioned above will give you higher Nodle Network rewards and can be easily done with the Hotspot app.

### Should I use the Hotspot app on my main phone?

No, the Hotspot app is meant to be used on old or secondary smartphones that you are no longer being used and that can be
recycled for that purpose, not on your main smartphone. 

### Will dedicated hardware be developed?

Nodle will neither develop nor sell hardware directly. However, some device manufacturers want to create dedicated hardware 
for the Nodle Network, and wish to integrate the Nodle software into their devices. The Nodle Network is an open network and 
anybody is welcome to create new ways to deploy edge nodes. The Hotspot app makes this effort much simpler than before. The 
Nodle development will support any device manufacturers who want to develop dedicated hardware.  

### Why is the Hotspot app available only on Android?

The Hotspot app is currently available only on Android for two main reasons:

- There is a much larger share of cheap old Android phones on Android than iOS-based devices.
- Hardware manufacturers will use a custom version of Android to run the Hotspot app on the custom hardware.

### Can I manage multiple hotspots?

Yes, you can manage multiple hotspots from the Nodle app. Initially, the management of hotspots will be done from the Nodle 
app. Depending on the demand from the community, a Web version of the management of the Hotspots might be added to the Nodle 
web client.
