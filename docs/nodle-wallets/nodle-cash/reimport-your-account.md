# (Re-)Importing Your Account on the Web

<iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zDOoSizhjmQ" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>

1. Once your words have been safely backed up, go to the **Accounts** page of the Nodle Cash web Wallet [https://nodlecode.github.io/polkadot-js-apps/#/accounts](https://nodlecode.github.io/polkadot-js-apps/#/accounts)
2. Go on the Web UI and click **Add Account** (If you are using the Polkadot.js extension on chrome, this will not work)
3. Give the account a name,  then paste your 12 words under **mnemonic seed**. (Double-check the spelling is correct, and that there aren't any extra spaces). Finally create a **password** (We recommend using a long, randomly generated password stored in a password manager). Don't Click "Next" just yet!

4.  Open the **Advanced Options** at the bottom, and select the **Edwards** curve. Nodle uses slightly different cryptographic scheme than the standard Polkadot.

5. Now Click **Next**, and **Save**.
