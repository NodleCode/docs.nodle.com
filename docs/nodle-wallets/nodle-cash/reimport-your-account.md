# (Re-)Importing Your Account on the Web

:::tip The polkadot.js extension may have deactivated in-browser storage by default
In this case you have to go into the settings tab in the top bar and change "in-browser account creation" to **allow** in the account settings section to be able to import your account.

1. Once your words have been safely backed up, go to the **Accounts** page of the nodleprotocol.io (Nodle Portal) [https://nodleprotocol.io/#/accounts](https://nodleprotocol.io/#/accounts)
2. Go on the Web UI and click **Add Account**
3. Give the account a name,  then paste your 12 words under **mnemonic seed**. (Double-check the spelling is correct, and that there aren't any extra spaces). Finally create a **password** (We recommend using a long, randomly generated password stored in a password manager). Don't Click "Next" just yet!

4.  Open the **Advanced Options** at the bottom, and select the **Edwards** curve. Nodle uses slightly different cryptographic scheme than the standard Polkadot.

5. Now Click **Next**, and **Save**.
