## About the Nodle app

### What is the Nodle network?

The Nodle network is a decentralized Bluetooth network built with smartphones by thousands of people like you.
Every smartphone serves as a node of the network helping transmit data from Bluetooth devices to their owners.
The network is built using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), making it mobile-data friendly and power-efficient.

### How is the Nodle network used?

The Nodle network is currently being used for tracking an asset's location, primarily through iBeacons.
It allows tracking parcels, finding lost or stolen electronic devices, locating leased vehicles, etc.
In the future, it can be used to manage any Bluetooth device, for example, weather monitors, traffic lights,
health monitors, etc.

### How does the Nodle app work?

All you need to join the Nodle network is to install the Nodle app and enable Bluetooth and location sharing
in the phone settings. Once you do this, your phone becomes a node of the Nodle network, helping transmit data
from Bluetooth devices around you. The information is then sent back to the owner of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) device.
Your personal data is not shared with the owner.

To better understand, increasingly more and more Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices with sensors all around us need to
transfer data back to their owners but only have Bluetooth radios in them (e.g., no WiFi or LTE). The Nodle app
uses the Bluetooth radio in your phone to connect to these IoT devices and securely transfers the data from Bluetooth
to LTE to whatever company owns the device (e.g., an e-Scooter, a pet with a tracking device, a cargo with a sensor).
The data collected includes mac address, geolocation, broadcasted beacon, and any specific data, which can be sent
to/from a device depending on its type.

### How is my location used?

The location of your device is only used to compute your rewards based on your contribution to network coverage,
and locate Bluetooth devices on request of their owners. The location is never used for any other purpose, shared or sold.

## Nodle token and Network rewards

### What is the NODL token?

NODL is the native cryptocurrency of the Nodle network. It creates an incentive for participants like you to come and
grow the network.

### What is the NODL token price?

You can check the price on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nodleiot/) or just type in your browser 
to get an answer.

### How are rewards calculated and allocated?

The amount of rewards you receive depends on your contribution to building the Nodle network and is calculated based on:
1. **App time availability** - the percentage of time the Nodle app has been running on a phone and connected to the Internet. 
3. **Bluetooth availability** - a metric indicating if the Bluetooth has been switched on on a phone. 
4. **Geographical coverage** - your contribution to the network coverage in visited H3 tiles, which is calculated based
on the number of nodes in each H3 tile.

The total amount of rewards is set per day and is shared among all network nodes. It means that the amount 
of rewards you receive will reduce over time as the network grows. However, the bigger the network, the higher the 
NODL token price on the market. You can check the current token daily issuance [here](https://docs.nodle.com/docs/tokenomics/issuance#issuance-table)

Rewards are calculated and allocated every 4 hours based on your and network activity from the time of the previous 
allocation.

### How can I earn more rewards?

Our app is specially designed to run at all times in background without impacting the user experience. All you need
is to make sure that your phone and the app are configured properly, particularly:
1. Bluetooth is switched on, and the Bluetooth permission is granted to the app
2. The location sharing permission is set to 'Always allowed'
3. The battery optimization setting is switched off for the app (applicable only for Android phones)
4. The developer mode is switched off on the phone

You can check granted permissions in the phone settings > Nodle app > Permissions, and all other settings in the
respective phone settings. The app will also notify you if some critical permissions are missing.

If your device and the app are configured properly you can use the following tips to maximize your rewards:
1. Make sure the app runs 24/7 either in foreground or background
2. Move as much as possible in order to create a wider coverage
3. If you have multiple devices with the Nodle app, then place them in different locations. Otherwise, your 
rewards will be split between those devices.

### How can I cash out or exchange my tokens?

First, we recommend you consider your tokens as an investment and keep them for the future. You will be able to sell 
them anytime, so there is no need to hurry.

If you want to sell or exchange your tokens, you can do it on any crypto exchange on which the NODL is listed. You can
check the list of exchanges and the current token price on the [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nodleiot/) or on the [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nodle-network). 
You need to deposit your tokens into your exchange account to trade them. To do this, you need to send your 
tokens to the deposit address provided by the exchange. Once the exchange receives tokens, you can trade them. 
Please check the deposit instructions of the selected exchange before sending your tokens.

## Wallet management

### How can I import my wallet from the Nodle app to the web?

Detailed instructions on [how to import your account from the app to the web](./reimport-your-account).

### How can I import my wallet to other wallets, like Polkadot JS, MetaMask, etc.?

We recommend you use [Talisman](../talisman/introduction) for managing your wallet on desktop. However, third parties 
such as Polkadot JS, SubWallet, or Nova should be compatible as well if you use a non-legacy Nodle wallet.

### What is a public key? Where can I find my public key?

A public key is a public address of your account. It can be shared with people so they can send you some Nodle Cash.
This is similar to your email address when people want to send you an email.

You can find your public key in the Nodle Cash app by clicking the "Receive" button below your balance.

### What is a legacy Nodle wallet?

The Nodle app has two wallet systems: legacy and non-legacy. Legacy Nodle wallet might be a bit more complex
to import to other wallets supporting NODL, or it might not be compatible with other wallets at all. Other than that, it
is a valid wallet, and you can use it as before.

If you have just joined the Nodle network, you have a non-legacy wallet. You can check it if you navigate to the screen 
with your public key by clicking the "Receive" button. The app will indicate whether you are using a legacy wallet or not.
If it does not say anything, you are using a non-legacy wallet.

If you use a legacy wallet, we recommend you switch to a new one.

### How can I switch to a new wallet from a legacy one?

The app can automatically upgrade your wallet during the wallet import if you have 0 balance.
In this case, you will get a new public key, which you need to share with your peers to receive transfers. Your 
12-word recovery phrase will not change, so you don't need to back up your wallet again. Your rewards and transfer
history will start from scratch.

Otherwise, it would be best to switch to a new wallet manually. It means that you need to create a new wallet and transfer
all your tokens there.
Here is what you need to do:
1. Make sure your current wallet is backed up! If not, backup your current wallet by going to Settings > Wallet Settings >
Recovery phrase
2. Disconnect your current wallet by going to Settings > Wallet settings > Disconnect wallet
3. Create a new wallet as you did it before
4. Backup the new wallet
5. Check your new wallet public key by clicking the "Receive" button and save it
6. Switch to your current wallet by disconnecting the new one and importing the current using a 12-word recovery phrase
7. Transfer your balance to the new wallet using your new public key by clicking the "Send" button
8. Switch back to your new wallet again
9. You are done! Continue enjoying the Nodle app!

### What if I received a transfer to a legacy wallet after being upgraded?

No worries, your tokens are not lost! You can [re-import your legacy wallet as an account to nodleprotocol.io](./reimport-your-account) and 
transfer your tokens to your new wallet. For the import, you should use your current 12-word recovery phrase, but select 
"Edwards" in the Advanced creation options selector.

### What is a private key? Where can I find my private key?

A private key is like a password — a string of letters and numbers — that allows you to access and manage your crypto 
funds. It is used to sign every transaction you make on the blockchain. A human-readable form of your wallet's private 
key is a recovery phrase (or "seed phrase", "mnemonics"). The recovery phrase is composed of 12 secret words. You can 
find your recovery phrase in the Nodle app by going to Settings > Wallet settings > Recovery phrase. It is very important 
to write down those words on paper and keep them somewhere safe and secure as it is the only way to access your tokens.

### How can I move my wallet to another device?

To move your account to another device, firstly, you need to backup your wallet on your current device.
You can do it in the Nodle app by going to Settings > Wallet Settings > Recovery phrase. As a result,
you will get your secret phrase consisting of 12 words that you will use to import your wallet to another device.

Once you back up your wallet, install the app on another device and use your 12-word phrase to import your wallet
to another device.

### How can I transfer my tokens to another Nodle wallet?

You can transfer your tokens to another Nodle wallet in the Nodle app. You need to know a public key of the
recipient’s wallet to do this. Once you have it, click on the “Send” button on the wallet tab and follow the instructions.
Please note that you will be charged a transaction fee for every transaction by the Polkadot blockchain. The fee amount
is calculated right before you confirm the transfer, and you can check it in the app. Once you confirm the transaction,
you will see it in the list of “Transfers” below your balance.

### How can I recover my wallet if I lose my recovery phrase?

Your account can be recovered only with your recovery phrase. Your recovery phrase is not available to anybody except you. So,
unfortunately, it is not possible to recover your account if you lose your recovery phrase.

### Is it possible to run the app on multiple devices with the same wallet?

We recommend you to create a separate account for each of your devices as it will be easier to track your rewards. We
also recommend using those devices in different locations to create a wider coverage and get higher rewards.

## Nodle Hotspots

### Can I use the Hotspot app without the main Nodle app?

No, the Hotspot app needs the Nodle app on your main phone to be configured and technically, your main device has the 
private key of your Hotspot and has the full right to collect the earnings. 

The Hotspot app does not have the private key, only the public key, and, therefore, you cannot transfer your earnings 
from the Hotspot app without the main Nodle app. In the future, another mode, such as Machine mode that could require 
a private key might be enabled on the Hotspot app.

### Will I earn more with the Hotspot app?

The Nodle Network rewards nodes for their availability and their geospatial coverage. It means that:

- You will earn more if you create stable and reliable Nodle Network coverage in your location, which can be reached by
 placing several phones in the same location
- You will earn more if you create wider Nodle Network coverage meaning you place several phones in different locations
 far away from each other
- You will earn more if the app is available 24/7 with a stable internet connection and Bluetooth switched on

All of that can be reached in the Nodle Hotspot app:

- You can keep up to 4 phones in the same location to create stable and reliable Nodle Network coverage in one place 
and get higher rewards.
- You can safely place the Hotspot device far away from you and from your other devices to create wider Nodle Network 
coverage. Nobody will be able to steal your NODL tokens as they can only be collected from the main Nodle app.
- The Hotspot app is aimed to be used on devices that are plugged in and online 24/7, it is likely that the availability 
will be greater than on the main phone.

All mentioned above will give you higher Nodle Network rewards and can be easily done with the Hotspot app.

### Should I use the Hotspot app on my main phone?

No, the Hotspot app is meant to be used on old or secondary smartphones that you are no longer being used and that can be
recycled for that purpose, not on your main smartphone. 

### Will dedicated hardware be developed?

Nodle will neither develop nor sell hardware directly. However, some device manufacturers want to create dedicated hardware 
for the Nodle Network, and wish to integrate the Nodle software into their devices. The Nodle Network is an open network and 
anybody is welcome to create new ways to deploy edge nodes. The Hotspot app makes this effort much simpler than before. The 
Nodle development will support any device manufacturers who want to develop dedicated hardware.  

### Why is the Hotspot app available only on Android?

The Hotspot app is currently available only on Android for two main reasons:

- There is a much larger share of cheap old Android phones on Android than iOS-based devices.
- Hardware manufacturers will use a custom version of Android to run the Hotspot app on the custom hardware.

### Can I manage multiple hotspots?

Yes, you can manage multiple hotspots from the Nodle app. Initially, the management of hotspots will be done from the Nodle 
app. Depending on the demand from the community, a Web version of the management of the Hotspots might be added to the Nodle 
web client.
