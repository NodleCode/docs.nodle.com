## About the Nodle app

### What is the Nodle network?

The Nodle network is a decentralized Bluetooth network built with smartphones by thousands of people like you.
Every smartphone serves as a node of the network helping transmit data from Bluetooth devices to their owners.
The network is built using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), making it mobile-data friendly and power-efficient.

### How is the Nodle network used?

The Nodle network is currently being used for tracking an asset's location, primarily through iBeacons.
It allows tracking parcels, finding lost or stolen electronic devices, locating leased vehicles, etc.
In the future, it can be used to manage any Bluetooth device, for example, weather monitors, traffic lights,
health monitors, etc.

### How does the Nodle app work?

All you need to join the Nodle network is to install the Nodle app and enable Bluetooth and location sharing
in the phone settings. Once you do this, your phone becomes a node of the Nodle network, helping transmit data
from Bluetooth devices around you. The information is then sent back to the owner of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) device.
Your personal data is not shared with the owner.

To better understand, increasingly more and more Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices with sensors all around us need to
transfer data back to their owners but only have Bluetooth radios in them (e.g., no WiFi or LTE). The Nodle app
uses the Bluetooth radio in your phone to connect to these IoT devices and securely transfers the data from Bluetooth
to LTE to whatever company owns the device (e.g., an e-Scooter, a pet with a tracking device, a cargo with a sensor).
The data collected includes mac address, geolocation, broadcasted beacon, and any specific data, which can be sent
to/from a device depending on its type.

### How is my location used?

The location of your device is only used to compute your rewards based on your contribution to network coverage,
and locate Bluetooth devices on request of their owners. The location is never used for any other purpose, shared or sold.
